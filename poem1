Poem 1

In Taipei's embrace, summer unfolds,
A symphony of warmth, as the tale is told.
Amidst bustling streets and bustling hearts,
The sun dances freely, its golden art.

The city awakens, vibrant and alive,
Bathing in sunlight, that helps it thrive.
A gentle breeze whispers through the trees,
Caressing the skin, like a lover's tease.

In Xinyi District, the skyscrapers rise,
As if reaching for the azure skies.
Taipei 101 stands tall and proud,
A beacon of progress, echoing aloud.

The night markets come alive at twilight,
With colorful lanterns casting their light.
Scents of delicious delicacies fill the air,
As laughter and chatter blend without a care.

Yangmingshan calls, with mountains so green,
A tranquil retreat, a nature's serene.
Hot springs beckon, to soak and unwind,
Soothing the body and calming the mind.

The rivers flow gracefully, ever serene,
Meandering through the city's bustling scene.
Damsels in bikinis, by Da'an's lakeside,
Laughing and splashing, in joyous stride.

Taipei's summer charms, a delightful display,
Where cultures blend and dreams have their say.
With warmth and energy, it brings us together,
A season of memories we'll cherish forever.

So let's revel in Taipei's summer's delight,
Basking in sunshine from morning till night.
For in this city's heart, the weather we find,
Is a gift to treasure, forever in mind.
